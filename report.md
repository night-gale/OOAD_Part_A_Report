### Project part A report

## **Project Abstract**
Inspired by the one of the most classical and famous player-made game map from *WarCraft 3*, we plan to develop a "Tower Defense" game that inherites some of the interesting and exciting features of it,
and, on top of that, includes more fancy and fantastic functionalities along with addional interaction between players that share a same side or play as oponents to exploit more fun out of it. 
The basic and also the key game mode of our game would be a online, multi-player and imbalanced combat game also known as Asymmetric Battle Arena Game. Players would be divided into two sides. 
While one of them play as "Monster" to attack, the others act as "Sustech" and defend themselves from "Monster".
To achieve that, a fairly good understanding about the APIs of the game engine--unreal that we are going to adopt is critical and vital. 
Moreover, the game experience largely depends on our design and understanding of network synchronization.
